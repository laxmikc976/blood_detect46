            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Blood detection using fingerprints involves developing a method to identify traces of blood on or near fingerprint impressions left at a crime scene or other surfaces. This process utilizes advanced forensic techniques, often involving chemical reagents or optical sensors, to detect the presence of blood in fingerprint ridges or around the fingerprint area. The goal is to identify whether blood has been deposited on a surface, potentially linking a person to a crime scene, or to aid in forensic investigations by providing valuable evidence for analysis. This technique combines fingerprint analysis with blood detection technologies to enhance criminal investigations and forensic science.</p>
